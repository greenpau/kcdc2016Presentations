# Introduction to D3.js

This repository contains the Presentation materials and supporting code for Introduction to [D3.js](https://d3js.org)

## Setup
Make sure to have **V3**
[d3.v3.js](https://d3js.org/d3.v3.js)
and
[d3.v3.min.js](https://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js)
copied into this level of the file system.

## Running Local Web Server

**You must have Python 3 installed** for these instructions to work.
_Otherwise, you can use your file browser to manually open and view examples._

Use the `start-web-server.bat` file to start up a local web server on port 8000.  On a Windows system you can simply double click on the batch file.

On a \*NIX system kick it off like a shell script:
`. start-web-server.bat`

Open your browser to `localhost:8000`

When you are done, you can stop the running webserver with a `<ctrl><c>`.
